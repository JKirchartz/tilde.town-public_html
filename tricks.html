    <h1>Kirch's Stupid ~ Tricks</h1>

    <h3>Connect to screen without a login shell</h3>
    <pre>
       ssh -t tilde.town screen -r
    </pre>
    <p>The magic here is provided by the `-t` flag, this tells ssh to force a pseudo-tty session, and run the command (here, `screen -r`) without starting a shell. 
    If you have OpenSSH 7.6 you can update your `.ssh/config` file to do this automatically with these lines
    <pre>
       Host tt
         ServerAliveInterval 30
         HostName tilde.town
         RequestTTY force
         RemoteCommand screen -r
    </pre>
    now you can connect directly to screen with `ssh tt`
    </p>

    <h3>Tunnel through an HTTPS connection<h3>
        <pre>
          ssh -tt &lt;server with HTTPS proxy&gt; -p 443 ssh -tt tildetown screen -RRD
        </pre>
        <p>This combines the trick above with another - basic ssh tunneling. </p>
        <p>If you have an account on tilde.team or blinkenshell.org, each offers an https proxy - tilde.team's is located at ssh.tilde.team</p>

    <h3>Ssh in from anywhere you connect to github from</h3>
    <pre>
      curl https://github.com/&lt;your user name&gt;.keys &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    </pre>
    <p>Github stores a copy of all the SSH keys you have authorized with it, this makes it easy to add yourself (or others) to servers and anything else requiring a key.</p>


    <h3>Remove duplicate ssh keys (without making temporary files)</h3>
    <pre>
      vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys +":sort u|wq"
    </pre>
    <p>This tells vim to open a file and run a few commands, in this case `:sort u` to uniquely sort the file, and `wq` to write and quit vim. The `|` tells vim that these are two separate commands (like `;` in most programming languages)</p>

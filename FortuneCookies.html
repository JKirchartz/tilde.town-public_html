<h1 class="title">A Brief History of Fortune Cookies</h1>
</header>
<p>Prophecy and Fortune predates written history. Omens, rods, dice, and other detritus and bric-a-brac manipulated by random chance have dominated the history of the universe. The I-Ching appeared in China in 1000 B.C. and was fully developed by the 3rd century B.C. using yarrow sticks to determine which of 64 messages guided the questioner’s fate. By the 3rd century A.D. Kua Cim, or Lottery Poetry, involved drawing lots from a collection of sticks with messages inscribed on them. A 14th century Chinese legend holds that messages hidden in mooncakes were used to organize a revolution against Mongolian rule, and begin the Ming dynasty. Edible fortune-telling was known in ancient Greece, and found in the tsujiura sebei of Japanese temples.</p>
<p>There may be evidence of prehistoric migration from China to the Americas, but large numbers came around the time of the California Gold Rush in the min 19th century. The majority worked in the mining and railroad industries and by 1850 there were five Chinese restaurants in San Francisco. (The first in Great Britain didn’t open until 1905.) At the time Chinese restaurants were known for excellent service and inexpensive food, but not fortune cookies.</p>
<p>Chinese in the Americas met with racial animosity through race riots and legal means as time went on. In 1882 the Chinese Exclusion Act ended migration to the United States from China; although the demand for, and animosity towards, exploitable migrant labor remained popular. Industrialists soon sought out cheap Japanese labor to offset the loss of migrants from China but these Japanese workers were greeted with the same racial animosity. In the late 1800s Benkyodo opened in San Francisco selling Japanese tea-cakes containing fortunes. Chinese enclaves were now pan-Asian.</p>
<p>…“Lo Mein Loophole”…</p>
<p>Japanese migration remained fairly open until 1924. In 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued executive order 9066, beginning the internment of thousands of Japanese people on the West Coast of the United States.</p>
<p>During both World Wars (1914–1918 and 1939-1945), troops were moved throughout the US before shipping out to various theaters of action. Many moved through California and discovered the Fortune Cookies served there, presenting them with the novelty of a good surprise in a world full of danger. Upon their return home, they began asking the local restaurateurs why they didn’t serve the “fortune tea cakes” they thought were a Chinese delicacy.` These “Chinese” fortune cookies were soon woven into America’s culture fabric.</p>

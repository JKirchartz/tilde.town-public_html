HOW TO RUIN EVERYTHING IN 7 STEPS (Vi Hart: Suspension of Disbelief
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deg1wmYjwtk)

1.  Create a Group Identity Around a Shared Belief. (e.g. Christianity)
2.  Create a Body of Rhetoric That the Group Can Repeat to Defend Their Belief
  (e.g. Education, promoting a false sense of superiority)
3. Spread the Word (e.g. Evangelism, educate others, expand the group) /
  Start Beef (e.g. Argue and Defend beliefs, possible light Stochastic
      Terrorism, etc -- to gain enemies)
4. Make Your Group Members Feel Like the Scum of the Earth and that
  Everyone Hates Them (outside of our group) (e.g. Evangelical
      Christians, a majority, self-identifying as feeling like the most
      oppressed group in America -- put them down by manufactured enemies
      "attacks"/"disrespect")
5. Escalate. (e.g. enhance Stochastic Terrorism, iterate 3 & 4 ad
      nauseam) 
6. Enemies beliefs don't exist/are uneducated/are doctrine/fake
(e.g. Crisis Actors, Paid Programmers)
7. Benevolent Dictatorship
